# QS-Ext-Jump-Start

QS-Ext-Jump-Start is a template project designed to help you quickly start building Qlik Sense extensions. It includes example code, testing tools, and setup guides to streamline development and testing.

See [CHANGELOG.md](./docs/CHANGELOG.md) for recent updates.

## Two Usage Modes

- Contribute as a fork: Prepare focused pull requests back to the source template to improve it. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Use as a starter template: Rename the extension, update your repository origin, and remove references to the original template as needed. See [Workflows & Tasks](./docs/WORKFLOWS.md).

## ⚡ Quick Start for Creating a New Extension

1. Click "Use this template" on [GitHub](https://github.com/QlikSenseStudios/qs-ext-jump-start)
2. Clone your repository and install dependencies: `git clone <your-repo> && cd <your-repo> && npm install`
3. Follow the setup guide for your environment in [docs/](./docs/)
4. Start the development server: `npm run serve`
5. Run tests: `npm test`
6. Package for deployment: `npm run package`

This template provides:

- Example extension code (see `src/`)
- Playwright-based testing setup (see `test/`)
- Nebula CLI development server
- Packaging and deployment scripts
- Setup guides for Qlik Cloud and Enterprise

### Selections Example (feature branch)

This template includes a simple selections-focused example to demonstrate best practices with Nebula’s `useSelections`:

- Exactly 1 dimension (required) and 0–1 measure (optional)
- Renders a two-column table: Dimension and Measure
- Clicking a dimension value starts a selection session and toggles values
- Highlights apply only in active selection mode; hover uses a translucent overlay to preserve background state
- Uses Qlik’s selection APIs via `useSelections.begin/select/cancel`
- Shows a helpful no-data message when the configuration is invalid (pick 1 dim, optional 1 measure)

See `src/index.js` and `src/styles.css` for the implementation, and `test/states/*.test.js` for E2E coverage.

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** - [Download](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** - Included with Node.js
- **Qlik Sense access** - Cloud or Enterprise environment

### Your Development Loop

```bash
# 1. Start development server (hot reload enabled)
npm run serve

# 2. Make changes to your extension in src/
# 3. See changes instantly at http://localhost:8000

# 4. Run tests to validate changes
npm test

# 5. Package for deployment when ready
npm run package
```

### Key Files to Edit

```

├── states/              # 🧪 Add your custom tests here
└── qlik-sense-app/      # 📂 Test data (load script)
```

### Testing Your Changes

The framework includes Playwright tests with Nebula hub interactions:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Watch tests in browser to see interactions
npx playwright test --headed

# Debug specific functionality
npx playwright test --grep "your test name" --debug
```

See [Testing Guide](./docs/TESTING.md) for detailed usage.

Notes for the selections example tests:

- Data state tests assert the presence of the two-column table and headers.
- No-data tests accept additional guidance text (they check that the message contains “No data to display”).
- Selection state tests detect the `.extension-container.in-selection` class and verify the table remains interactive.

## 🌐 Environment Setup

Choose your Qlik Sense environment:

Both guides include:

- Prerequisites for Qlik Cloud or Enterprise
- Step-by-step setup instructions
- Configuration for development and testing

## 🚀 Deployment

### Local Packaging & Deployment

```bash
# Create deployment package
npm run package

# Output: <your-extension>-ext/
# Zip this folder to upload to Qlik Sense
```

See deployment guides for your environment.
